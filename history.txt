- v3.1.0 now matches constructors and destructors.
- v3.1.1 fixes problem wherein function calls were replacing function declaration that contained the updateAllViews calls.

- v3.4.0 New Script for transactions.
- v4.0.0 Time for a new major release. Only changes are that some of the partial results have been moved to full because they were using the hint UV_CLEAR_GRAPHIC_CACHE_AND_FULL_REDRAW.
